# Week 1: 0829-0905 #

### Portrait exercise in the Studio Foundation class
Drawing portraits of classmates is a really fun activity! Itâ€™s a great way to quickly break the ice and get to know each other better through art (plus, you get to observe them closelyâ€”haha!).  

The image below shows a portrait of me drawn by a classmate. **What a wonderful drawing!**

<img width="600" alt="Cool Phone Stand" src="assets/IMG_9806.jpg"> 

### Drawing Toast in the Design Framework class
During the activity, I noticed that each person had a different understanding of the requirements. Making toast may seem simple, but everyone had their own methodâ€”one person even drew 22 steps to make toast! Despite this, all of our sketches included steps and arrows, just as highlighted in the video. **Sorting out the process is the first step to understanding the whole of a complex problem.** After reorganizing, we ended up with a simplified process that clearly highlighted the underlying issues.

<img width="600" alt="Cool Phone Stand" src="assets/IMG_9807.jpg">

### Laser-cutting exercise for the Technology Design Foundations class
This week, I completed the Jacobs **online laser cutter training**. Although I had used a laser cutter frequently before, I still had trouble getting familiar with the new system.  

<img width="600" alt="Cool Phone Stand" src="assets/IMG_9811.jpg">

For this assignment, I designed a phone stand. However, since I didn't have the exact thickness of the wood boards, my design failed during assembly. As you can see, there is a part that didnâ€™t fit into the holes. Next time, I will measure the thickness of the material before doing the design.

Regarding the design process, I initially aimed for a rotating support for the phone stand, which required several attempts to test different structures using Rhino. I also researched various laser-cutting products online to gather ideas about the structure. Despite multiple failures, I concluded that testing the design with actual materials would be most effective. Consequently, I created the first version, laser-cut it, and used this prototype to explore different structures for the rotating support.

<img width="600" alt="Cool Phone Stand" src="assets/IMG_9814.jpg">


<span id="hashtag"> **#Speculations** </span>  
We now need an **environment equipped with a variety of tools and materials** (like the Makerspace) to design numerous products or mechanisms. In the future, if we have a product (whether physical or digital) that allows us to **develop ideas within a virtual 3D environment** and includes simulated materials, we would be able to iterate quickly and create designs that are practical and usable.

# Week 2: 0906-0912 #

This week, I visited **BLICK Art Material** to explore tools and interesting materials that can be used in the following classes. 

<img width="600" alt="Cool Phone Stand" src="assets/IMG_9826_.png">

I explored several Rhino grasshopper tutorials this week. I learned how to build 3D models through diagrams and the logic of connection between each block.

This model is a bottle.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper tutorials" src="assets/0912 Rhino Screenshot_.png">

This is an exercise about creating lines between three curves automatically.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper tutorials" src="assets/0909 Rhino Screenshot.png">

This picture shows that I adjusted the parameters from the file.  

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper tutorials" src="assets/0912 Rhino Screenshot.png">

And then, in the Monday class, I joined the group teaching how to use Prusa mk3s+ 3D printers.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper tutorials" src="assets/0912 3D printing.png">

<span id="hashtag"> **#Speculations** </span>  

During this process, I wondered why it was necessary to use additional software to adjust settings before printing with a 3D printer. I imagined that, after exporting the STL file, we could directly upload it to the 3D printer, which would automatically adjust each parameter to ensure a successful print.

Additionally, if a 3D projector were integrated into the 3D printer, it could allow us to preview the product's size directly on the build plate.

# Week 3: 0913-0919 #

### Keep working on Project 1

For my Project 1 assignment, I decided to design an iPad stand. 

I began by researching ideas on Pinterest, then measured the dimensions and sketched a design for the stand. 

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/Untitled_Artwork.jpg">

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/Untitled_Artwork 2.jpg">


I started creating a new 3D model using Grasshopper. I began by designing two surfaces for the top and bottom of the stand, then connected them to form a solid object.

Next, I created an iPad and subtract it.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 12.06.25.png">

I then used a solid object to subtract the section that would obstruct the iPad screen.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 12.05.58.png">

Finally, I exported the model as a STEP file and imported it into Solidworks to make slight adjustments to its appearance. If I had more time, I would learn how to use Rhino and Grasshopper to refine the design.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 12.05.29.png">



<span id="hashtag"> **#Reflections** </span>  

To learn Grasshopper, I spent a lot of time learning the basic commands. However, I felt that I should also randomly explore the interface to see how much I could accomplish without any prior experience.

<span id="hashtag"> **#Speculations** </span>   

While creating the 3D model, I kept thinking about how great it would be to control the design with sentences. For example, 'I want to create a 30cm x 20cm box, then subtract a 10cm x 5cm box from the front.' This would eliminate the need to learn the software, reducing the learning curve.

# Week 4: 0920-0926 #

This weekend, I spent approximately a whole afternoon completing the Project 1 Report.  
It was quite interesting to see feedback from other classmates.
The feedback was super helpful and I was inspired. 
While doing the report, several ideas for improvement came to my mind, so I wrote them in the report.

I did this assignment with a classmate, and we discussed what content should be included in the report.   
we also watched the videos in the Project 1 playlist together.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/report.png">

After the TDF Monday class, I started to pay attention to personal devices in my daily life. Then, I created an ecosystem map for personal devices.  

To be honest, before doing this assignment, I never thought about how these devices connect, or what technology is involved. The connections between these devices are unconscious for me.  

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/ecosystem map_.png">

  





<span id="hashtag"> **#Reflections** </span>  

After doing this assignment, I realized that I should learn how connections work between personal devices. Then, I can speculate what kind of devices should be connected to enhance the convenience of daily life.


<span id="hashtag"> **#Speculations** </span>  

In our daily lives, there are always some tasks that we perform every day, such as opening the curtains, turning on the lights, and starting the diffuser. If we could preset the on and off times for these devices, we would save a lot of time managing them. I look forward to having this kind of lifestyle in the near future.

# Week 5: 0927-1003 #

### S08 2024/09/26 w05 Th ###

For this assignment, we needed to modify the pin configuration in the code. As a result, I was able to compile and flash the program successfully and efficiently.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/04_make_it_blink_test.png">

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/05_make_it_blink_outside_test.png">



### S09 2024/09/30 w06 M ###

For this assignment, I chose these three tutorials: 
1. fsr (force sensitive resistor) -> RGB-led color fader
2. Button Send on change
3. fsr (force sensitive resistor) -> RGB-led color fader

**âž” fsr (force sensitive resistor) -> RGB-led color fader**

I failed to compile this file initially, so I checked each connection and followed the steps carefully. 

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-10-03 at 00.59.02.png">

After adjusting some connections, I recompiled it. This time, the error was reduced.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-10-03 at 01.04.14.png">

I didn't know what to do, so I asked ChatGPT.
It told me to add two lines of code.

`void setColor(int R, int G, int B);  `  
`void setTarget(int red, int green, int blue);`

Then, I compiled successfully!

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-10-03 at 01.15.27.png">

But I failed to flash. ðŸ˜¿  

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-10-03 at 01.15.52.png">

Then, I found that it was due to the wrong particle platform. 
I fixed it so it was FLASHED SUCCESSFULLY!

<span id="hashtag"> **#Reflections** </span>  

One of the key challenges I faced was ensuring the correct configuration of the hardware and code, particularly when it came to handling interrupts and managing timing. Initially, I encountered an issue where the interrupt function wasnâ€™t recognized in the code, which forced me to dive deeper into how the scope of function declarations works in embedded systems. By addressing this, I strengthened my understanding of the importance of code structure and organization. I now feel more confident in my ability to troubleshoot and adapt to unexpected challenges in future projects.


<span id="hashtag"> **#Speculations** </span>  

While the current program is tailored to a specific hardware setup (LED and button), there is potential for scaling this to larger systems. The program could be adapted to control more complex output devices, such as motors or servos, and respond to multiple input triggers, expanding its functionality for broader applications in interactive devices or IoT solutions.

Although the current system functions well for its intended purpose, exploring dynamic inputs, debouncing mechanisms, and non-blocking operations could greatly improve performance, robustness, and user experience.

# Week 6: 1004-1010 #

### S10 2024/10/03 w06 Th ###

I tried for more than 2 hours on Saturday morning and I'm still stuck at this stage (as shown in the picture).

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-10-05 at 11.14.04.png">

I flashed successfully during the TDF class on Monday because a classmate helped me with that. The tutorial on the Slack channel is helpful as well!!

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-10-07 at 17.57.57.png">  
<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/IMG_0431.JPG">   

I formed a group in Monday's class. This was our original ideation about our project.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/IMG_0432.JPG">

Based on that, we rethink the topic, and we would like to focus on pulse rate detection.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-10-10 at 12.22.33.png">

After doing research, we created this diagram as our "Draft System Architecture".

<span id="hashtag"> **#Reflections** </span>  

This week was particularly challenging due to the volume of assignments, especially with the added pressure of building a proposal for Project 2 with a newly formed team. I had just learned how to compile a Photon 2 code file and was still unsure how to apply this tool in a practical context. Despite that, we had only three days to put together a complete proposal. I realize the proposal might not be perfect and is likely to undergo significant changes in the coming days, which left me feeling frustrated.

<span id="hashtag"> **#Speculations** </span> 

Iâ€™m excited about the idea weâ€™re developing for our proposal. If we can successfully combine pulse rate monitoring with productivity, it could have potential applications in both the health and tech industries. By making pulse rate visible, we could adjust our work and break times based on our individual physiological needs. It would be amazing to see this idea come to life!

# Week 7: 1011-1017 #

In Thursday's class, we received some feedback on our proposal, with the key takeaway being the importance of making the system more practical and reasonable.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/notes.png">

This is the second version of our proposal, as we initially weren't aware that the project required using three inputs and two outputs. We added a loudness sensor and a motion sensor as inputs for our project.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/TDF Team CUDies_.jpg">

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/TDF Team CUDies.jpg">

We have developed our first version of the code, which ensures that the system functions properly. It is gratifying to see data consistently appearing in the Serial Monitor.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/flash success.png">

The next step was to publish data to the console, and as shown in the picture below, we successfully retrieved data from Photon 2.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/publish success.png">

Next, we attempted to subscribe to the data from the console and transfer it to the second Photon 2.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/suscribe success.png">

However, we encountered a situation in which we were uncertain about the cause of the error in our code.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/error.png">


<span id="hashtag"> **#Reflections** </span> 

Reflecting on my recent experiences, I recognize the challenges I faced in the programming world due to my limited knowledge of coding. While I successfully developed the first version of our code and ensured the system functioned properly, I encountered difficulties in understanding certain errors that arose. This situation highlighted the importance of foundational knowledge in coding, which would enable me to better comprehend what is happening within the code. As I saw data consistently appearing in the Serial Monitor, I felt a sense of accomplishment, but I also realized that gaining a deeper understanding of coding fundamentals would significantly enhance my confidence and ability to troubleshoot issues effectively in the future.



<span id="hashtag"> **#Speculations** </span> 

I hope that in the future, we will have programming systems that can automatically debug code without requiring manual intervention. Such systems could employ machine learning techniques to recognize common coding pitfalls and offer real-time suggestions or modifications. This would not only save significant time and reduce frustration for developers but also allow individuals with limited coding knowledge to engage more confidently with programming.

# Week 8: 1018-1024 #

Over the weekend, we worked with the Google API to display three pieces of data.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/IMG_0758.JPG">

After working for an hour and a half, we resolved the display issue.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/IMG_0762.JPG">

Then, we adjusted the code to enable the motion sensor to activate the vibration.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-10-24 at 10.42.18.png">

After seeking help from Anker, a student from Cohort 4, we finally obtained the accurate BPM to display people's heart rates.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-10-24 at 10.42.32.png">

In the meantime, I created a 3D model of a wearable device designed for parents. Here is my sketch.

<img width="600" alt="Rhino grasshopper objects" src="assets/IMG_0823.JPG">

I used Fusion 360 to create the 3D models.
