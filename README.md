This week, I designed a phone stand.

Initially, I hoped its head could rotate, but it took me a couple of times to deal with the mechanism. Then, I give up.

Reflections
in complete sentences or paragraphs, and perhaps images or videos.
reflections on what you learned and how you learned it
an assessment of the state of your work
Speculations
in complete sentences or paragraphs, and perhaps images or videos.
speculation on future direction for the tools [so much is changing very quickly right now, where do you think this is going? Why do you think this?]
speculation on future direction for the work
bonus: thoughtful descriptions of something interesting and relevant you heard about in the news or industry publications. include text, an image, a link, and a reference that you can follow up on later and share with your peers.
Images & Video
images & video should be unified with your presentation (not just a folder of images)
images & video should be directly relevant to the project (What does each shot show us?)
Sketches, Drawings, and Diagrams
this could include flowcharts, design files, whiteboarding, storyboards, etc
pencil & paper sketches, drawings, post-its, etc (photographed or scanned and uploaded)
