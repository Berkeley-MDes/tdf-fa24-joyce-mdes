# Week 1: 0829-0905 #

### Portrait exercise in the Studio Foundation class
Drawing portraits of classmates is a really fun activity! Itâ€™s a great way to quickly break the ice and get to know each other better through art (plus, you get to observe them closelyâ€”haha!).  

The image below shows a portrait of me drawn by a classmate. **What a wonderful drawing!**

### Drawing Toast in the Design Framework class
During the activity, I noticed that each person had a different understanding of the requirements. Making toast may seem simple, but everyone had their own methodâ€”one person even drew 22 steps to make toast! Despite this, all of our sketches included steps and arrows, just as highlighted in the video. **Sorting out the process is the first step to understanding the whole of a complex problem.** After reorganizing, we ended up with a simplified process that clearly highlighted the underlying issues.

### Laser-cutting exercise for the Technology Design Foundations class
This week, I completed the Jacobs **online laser cutter training**. Although I had used a laser cutter frequently before, I still had trouble getting familiar with the new system.

For this assignment, I designed a phone stand. However, since I didn't have the exact thickness of the wood boards, my design failed during assembly. As you can see, there is a part that didnâ€™t fit into the holes. Next time, I will measure the thickness of the material before doing the design.

Regarding the design process, I initially aimed for a rotating support for the phone stand, which required several attempts to test different structures using Rhino. I also researched various laser-cutting products online to gather ideas about the structure. Despite multiple failures, I concluded that testing the design with actual materials would be most effective. Consequently, I created the first version, laser-cut it, and used this prototype to explore different structures for the rotating support.

<span id="hashtag"> **#Speculations** </span>  
We now need an **environment equipped with a variety of tools and materials** (like the Makerspace) to design numerous products or mechanisms. In the future, if we have a product (whether physical or digital) that allows us to **develop ideas within a virtual 3D environment** and includes simulated materials, we would be able to iterate quickly and create designs that are practical and usable.

# Week 2: 0906-0912 #

This week, I visited **BLICK Art Material** to explore tools and interesting materials that can be used in the following classes.

I explored several Rhino grasshopper tutorials this week. I learned how to build 3D models through diagrams and the logic of connection between each block.

This model is a bottle.

This is an exercise about creating lines between three curves automatically.

This picture shows that I adjusted the parameters from the file.

And then, in the Monday class, I joined the group of teaching how to use Prusa mk3s+ 3D printers.
